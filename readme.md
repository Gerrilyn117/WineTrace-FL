Source code for paper: One-shot federated learning based on synthetic data for identifying the geographical origin of Chinese wine

We propose a one-shot federated learning framework for wine geographical origin identification, where local latent diffusion models generate synthetic mineral element data, and a global classifier is collaboratively trained to identify the geographical origin of wine.
